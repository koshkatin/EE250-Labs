Question 1: How did the reliability of UDP change when you added 50% loss to your local
environment? Why did this occur?
    UDP did not deliver all the messages and dropped some due to congestion. 
    This occurs because UDP prioritizes speed over realiability.

Question 2: How did the reliability of TCP change? Why did this occur? 
    TCP remained reliable and delivered all messages but with much longer delay.
    This is because TCP is a reliable protocol and prioritizes sending all messages over speed. 

Question 3: How did the speed of the TCP response change? Why might this happen?
    TCP became much slower. This happens because TCP has to ensure it sends all messages
    in the correct order and uses congestion control protocols that introduce delay.
